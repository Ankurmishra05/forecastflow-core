# forecastflow-core
The core Python library for the ForecastFlow MLOps platform.
Project Title: ForecastFlow
An End-to-End MLOps Platform for Time-Series Forecasting

1. Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a full-stack, end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to solve a critical business problem: time-series forecasting. The platform, named "ForecastFlow," uses a robust architecture to ingest data, generate advanced features, and train a high-performance XGBoost model that can be used for real-world predictions.

The final model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 46.45 on the test set, outperforming a classic forecasting model and showcasing a highly accurate and scalable solution.

2. Key Features
Advanced Feature Engineering: Creation of time-based, lag, and rolling window features from raw time-series data.

Model Comparison: Implementation and evaluation of two distinct forecasting approaches: a statistical model (Prophet) and a machine learning model (XGBoost).

End-to-End Pipeline: The project covers the full machine learning lifecycle, from data handling to model training and evaluation.

Professional Documentation: The entire process is documented to ensure reproducibility and clear communication of results.

3. Project Methodology
The project followed a structured, professional workflow:

Data Ingestion & Validation: Cleaned and validated raw time-series data, ensuring the integrity of the datetime index.

Feature Engineering: Engineered a rich set of features, including year, month, lag_n, and rolling_mean, to provide the model with a deeper understanding of the time-series dynamics.

Sequential Data Splitting: Used a sequential train/test split to prevent data leakage, a critical best practice in time-series forecasting.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Baseline Model (Prophet): Trained Prophet to establish a robust baseline and capture seasonality.

Final Model (XGBoost): Trained XGBoost on the engineered features, utilizing early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve performance.

Results & Analysis: The performance of both models was rigorously evaluated using RMSE, and the results were presented in a clear, professional summary.
